# Reminder Bot  
  
A simple autonomous script paired with the Twilio  
API to send a reminder once a day.  
  
Uses Python timezones, arg-parsing, and a simple   
joke fetching API.  
  
Crontab addition is planned for, but not implemented yet since I don't pay for running remotely on a server :blush:
